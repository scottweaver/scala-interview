# Scala Interview Questions

## Functions
1. Scala is functional/OO hybrid language.  One of the most important ideas of a functional langauge is that a function is a "first class citizen".  What does that mean?

2. What is a higher-order function?

3. There are two methods for composing functions.  What are they?
  1. How are they different?

4. What is a Partial Function?

5. What is a Partially Applied Function?
  1.  What happens when you 'lift' a partial function?

6. What is currying?

## Data Structures

1. There a two primary ways to create an immutable List in Scala, what are they?

2. Scala has the datatype `Option`.  What is it used for?  Why is it better than null?


## Design and Language Constructs
1. What is the difference between a `trait` and a `class`?

2. What is a `sealed trait`?  When would you use one?

3. In Scala, when we refer to pattern matching, what does that mean?

4. In Scala, there is a construct known as a "for comprehension" which can be used to loop over a collection.  However, it is far more powerful than that. What is its use outside of iteration.


## Functional Paradigms
1. Many data structures in Scala have a `map` function. What does `map` do from a general standpoint?

2. Many of the structures that have a `map` function also have a `flatmap` function as well.  What does `flatmap` do?  How is it different than `map`?

3. The structures with both `map` and `flatmap` have a special term that describes them relative to functional programming.  What is that term?

4. What is a type class?  Give me an example of a good use of a type class.
